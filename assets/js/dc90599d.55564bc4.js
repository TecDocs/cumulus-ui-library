Instead, it journeys through a carefully structured series of Approval Flows. These flows act as guardrails that preserve quality, scalability, and accessibility at every stage. They are more than just administrative checkpoints; they are the invisible operating system that ensures every contribution fits seamlessly into the whole.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"confluence/confluence-sops":{"id":"confluence/confluence-sops","title":"\ud83d\udcd8 Confluence SOPs","description":"When teams build and maintain a design system at scale, they quickly discover that documentation alone is not enough. Simply describing components and patterns is insufficient. Without structure and shared practices, even well\u2011designed libraries can lose alignment and clarity over time. The Cumulus UI Library solves this by integrating Confluence\u2011based Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that define how contributions are proposed, reviewed, and finalized.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"confluence/connected-docs":{"id":"confluence/connected-docs","title":"\ud83d\udd17 Connected Docs","description":"Once a component successfully navigates the Approval Flows, the next challenge is keeping its documentation accurate and synchronized across every platform your team depends on.

Without rules, even the most beautiful components collapse under inconsistency, last\u2011minute hacks, and unpredictable edge cases. A mature design system is more than a library, it is a visual language that every contributor can speak fluently. At Cumulus, this language is defined through style rules that shape spacing, rhythm, composition, typography, and interactivity.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"knowledge-base/versioning-strategy":{"id":"knowledge-base/versioning-strategy","title":"\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Versioning Strategy","description":"---","sidebar":"sidebar"},"storybook/storybook-components":{"id":"storybook/storybook-components","title":"Storybook Components","description":"Explore a curated collection of interactive components that power our Storybook library.

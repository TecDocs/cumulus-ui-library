# 📚 Storybook Components
<FloatInLeft>
Explore a curated collection of **interactive components** that power our **Storybook library**. Each one has been deliberately built to go far beyond a basic UI snippet. They are presented here not as isolated examples, but as **living artifacts** of the system’s architecture, each one serving as proof of how design tokens, accessibility principles, and theme logic come together in practice.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>
Every component in this library is **production‑ready**. They have been reviewed for **consistency**, **scalability**, and **accessibility**, ensuring that they can be integrated into real projects without additional refactoring. The documentation around each component follows a **system‑driven approach**, clarifying behavior, states, and dependencies so that contributors can trust what they see.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>
These elements are powered by **modern design tokens** and **theme‑adaptive styles**, with carefully tuned transitions that deliver polished, responsive experiences across both light and dark modes. This approach is not simply aesthetic; it enforces a standard of maintainability and repeatability that is expected at the **enterprise level**.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>
As you move through the cards below, observe patterns such as **accessibility checklists**, **audit trails**, **onboarding workflows**, and **permission logic**. Together, these patterns reveal how the system balances visual quality with architectural rigor, creating a set of **reusable components** that can grow and adapt over time.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>
Each card is fully interactive. Selecting a title or card takes you directly to its page in the live **Storybook environment**, where you can explore props, states, and styling rules in context. This makes the section both a **reference guide** and an **active learning environment**, offering immediate insight into how the system is built and how you can build on it.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>
Use this library as a **blueprint**. Study the implementations, extend them, or adapt them to new use cases. Each component link provides not just a view, but a starting point for deeper exploration, ensuring that you can translate system knowledge into practical, high‑quality contributions.

## What’s Next

<FloatInLeft>
Having explored how Storybook serves as the interactive proof of our components, the next step is to understand how this technical clarity is paired with process clarity. Storybook shows you **how components behave**, but Confluence documents **how teams work together** to maintain and evolve those components. In the following section, you will see how contribution workflows, approval processes, and operational standards are captured, reviewed, and communicated across teams.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>
Moving into the **Confluence** section provides the other half of the system: not just the what, but the how. This ensures that the same level of consistency and precision you see in the components is mirrored in the way they are governed and improved over time.

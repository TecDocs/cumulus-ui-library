# ‚ôø Accessibility
</FloatInPlace>

<FloatInLeft>
**Accessibility is not simply a requirement to check off**. It is a **core responsibility** shared across design, development, and documentation. At Cumulus, we treat accessibility as a **foundational principle**‚Äîon par with tokens, themes, responsiveness, and scalability.

A component is not truly complete until it works **seamlessly for every user**, regardless of device, assistive tool, or input method. This section outlines how accessibility is built into the structure of our system and what every contributor must internalize to uphold it.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Accessibility at Cumulus means **inclusive interaction**, **clear focus management**, and **contrast** that adapts across themes. It means ensuring that **keyboard navigation is smooth**, **screen reader support is comprehensive**, and all visual indicators respect both the **token system** and **WCAG standards**. When you build accessibly, you‚Äôre not just serving users with disabilities‚Äîyou‚Äôre **improving clarity, trust, and overall usability** for everyone who touches the product.

## üåê Accessibility as a System Principle

<FloatInLeft>
We do not layer accessibility on top of finished designs. Instead, we **bake it in from the beginning**. It is embedded in our **token definitions**, in **component logic**, and in **usage documentation**. When you make a contribution to Cumulus, you are not just submitting a feature‚Äîyou are joining a **shared agreement on inclusivity**. That agreement covers **semantic HTML**, **ARIA roles**, **keyboard control**, and **focus visibility**. If your component cannot be operated or understood by everyone, then it cannot be merged.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Just as tokens provide **layout consistency**, accessibility ensures **consistent behavior and user experience**. A **tooltip** that is invisible to keyboard users is broken, regardless of visual design. A **button** without a visible focus state may technically function, but it **fails the inclusive experience test**. Accessibility is what binds **visual intention** to **practical usability**‚Äîand that connection defines trust in a design system.

## üé® Contrast, Focus, and Token Responsibility

<FloatInLeft>
Every accessible experience begins with **visual clarity**. If text cannot be read or elements are hard to distinguish, then no amount of interaction polish matters. This is why **contrast** is so critical‚Äîand why we rely entirely on **semantic tokens** for color control. Cumulus never hardcodes values like `#888` or `#111`. Instead, we use tokenized values like `--color-foreground` and `--color-muted` to guarantee **accessible contrast** across all supported themes.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
**Focus management** is another major accessibility touchpoint. Developers often remove outlines for aesthetic reasons, but this breaks the experience for keyboard users unless replaced with a **theme-aware**, **token-driven indicator**. Focus states must be **visible**, **adaptable**, and **consistent across modes**. Accessibility is not anti-aesthetic‚Äîit ensures **aesthetics never come at the cost of usability**.
</FloatInRight>

<ContrastFailPreview
  fail={{ text: "#888", bg: "#fff", label: "Low Contrast" }}
  pass={{ text: "var(--color-foreground)", bg: "var(--color-surface)", label: "Token-Based Contrast" }}
/>

## üß© Component-Level Accessibility Expectations

<FloatInLeft>
All components must follow accessibility **patterns that guarantee reliability** across devices and interaction modes. Buttons should have **accessible labels** and **visible focus states**. Inputs must be **operable via screen readers** and provide **clear validation messaging**. Tooltips must **never rely solely on hover**. These standards are not guidelines‚Äîthey are **mandatory for every contribution**.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Interactive components like **modals** must **trap focus properly** and offer **escape key handling**. **Checkboxes** should replicate native behavior, including toggling via keyboard. Forms must be labeled with native HTML `<label>` elements‚Äînot just placeholders. These patterns form the **foundation of usable components** and enable smooth integration into the wider system.

## ‚úÖ Recap and What‚Äôs Next

<FloatInLeft>
By now, you‚Äôve seen how accessibility is embedded into the foundation of Cumulus, not layered on as a last-minute fix. But accessibility is only one thread in the broader fabric of **contribution quality**. Equally important are the **rules of expression**‚Äîhow you write, structure, and deliver your components to align with the **visual and behavioral consistency** of the system. These rules help us maintain a **shared voice**, reduce ambiguity, and ensure every contribution feels like it came from the same source, even if it didn‚Äôt.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Where accessibility governs **inclusion and interaction**, style rules govern **tone**, **terminology**, **structure**, and **clarity**. The words you choose, the tokens you apply, the order in which states are declared‚Äîthese are not arbitrary. They form a **living contract** between contributors and maintainers. In the next section, we‚Äôll define the **contribution style rules** that make documentation predictable, scalable, and universally understandable. Together, they ensure the system is not just accessible, but **coherent**.

# üìê Style Rules
</FloatInPlace>

<FloatInLeft>
Design systems must operate with **clarity**. Without **structure**, even the most beautiful components crumble under inconsistency, edge-case chaos, and unpredictable behavior. A true design system is not just a pattern collection, it is a **visual language**. At Cumulus, this language is built on a system of **enforceable style rules** that govern layout, rhythm, composition, and interactivity.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
These **style rules** define how spacing flows, how typography scales, how feedback is triggered, and how visual elements adapt across themes. They serve as **foundational logic** for everything downstream, including every button hover, modal transition, and text block spacing. When these rules are honored, systems breathe; when they‚Äôre ignored, the system fractures.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
This guide presents not just the rules, but the **reasoning behind each one**. You'll find examples of effective design alongside common pitfalls. Components are visual structures, and the rules that govern them must be **practical**, **scalable**, and **theme-aware**. Our goal is to build **stability at every layer**, so contributors can focus on functionality, not fixing layout bugs.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
From tokenized spacing to role-based elevation shifts, each section in this guide expands your understanding of how **visual consistency drives user confidence**. These aren't arbitrary suggestions, they are **strategic constraints**, optimized for clarity, performance, and cross-team collaboration.
</FloatInRight>

## üìè Layout & Spacing Rhythm

<FloatInLeft>
**Spacing** is more than aesthetics, it sets rhythm. Rhythm leads to flow, and flow is what makes complex interfaces feel intuitive rather than overwhelming. At Cumulus, we use a fixed token system such as **4px, 8px, 16px, and 32px** to align all padding, margin, and gap properties.
</FloatInLeft>

<RhythmSpacingWaves
  tokens={["4px", "8px", "16px", "32px"]}
  irregularToken="12px"
/>

<AnimatedFigureCaption style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>

</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInRight>
Using **fixed intervals** ensures vertical and horizontal rhythm across screens. Developers no longer debate if 10px feels better than 12px; designers don't second-guess margins. Everyone speaks the same rhythm, making updates seamless and scalable.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
Avoiding arbitrary values also improves **responsiveness**. Grid systems and flexbox layouts snap naturally when spacing is predictable. Elements align, gutters breathe, and stacking behavior becomes frictionless. The token system becomes a **visual metronome**.
</FloatInLeft>

## üî§ Typography Consistency

<FloatInRight>
**Typography** is one of the first things users encounter. It must speak clearly. Good typography establishes **visual hierarchy**, maintains **accessibility**, and enables users to scan content without strain. When heading levels blur, or spacing collapses, users hesitate, and hesitation is friction.
</FloatInRight>

<StylePreviewRowCloud

/>

<AnimatedFigureCaption style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>
Figure 2. Strong typography uses distinct font sizes, weight, and spacing to maintain scannability and clarity.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
A system should **enforce spacing** above and below headings. It should assign meaning to font scale, not use arbitrary values. For instance, an **H2** should always sit at a consistent distance from nearby content and follow **semantic intent**. Designers must avoid using identical sizes for H3 and H4 headings or assigning bold weight to unrelated labels.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
In Cumulus, typography follows a **vertical rhythm** matched to spacing tokens. This ensures every section header, paragraph, and button label fits into the same grid logic. We enforce **line-height ranges** for legibility and set **max-widths** for content blocks to avoid wide, hard-to-read text walls.
</FloatInRight>

---

## üß± Component Composition

<FloatInLeft>
Each UI component in Cumulus follows a **structural layout model**. That model includes a header zone, content area, interaction row, and feedback zone. These are not suggestions, they are **enforced slots** within the system‚Äôs design frame. This ensures padding and spacing behave consistently across variants and themes.
</FloatInLeft>

<ComponentStructureOverlay
  caption="Each component is built from structured zones that align to token spacing and layout logic."

<AnimatedFigureCaption style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>

</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInRight>
**Composition prevents drift**. It keeps interactive rows aligned regardless of button count. It ensures error states appear in the correct location. This is especially critical on mobile and small screens, where predictable stacking behavior is essential.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
When a contributor adds a new feature to a card, they know exactly where to insert it. No guessing, no trial and error. This makes documentation easier and improves the confidence of engineers and designers. We call this **compositional safety**, and it‚Äôs one of the system‚Äôs most powerful enablers.
</FloatInLeft>

## üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Feedback

<FloatInRight>
**Hover states, active states**, and **focus rings** provide affordance. Without them, users are left to guess which elements are interactive. Feedback is not flair, it is a form of **interface guidance**.
</FloatInRight>

<StylePreviewRowCloud
  goodExampleImg="/cumulus-ui-library/img/hover-focus-good.png"
  badExampleImg="/cumulus-ui-library/img/hover-focus-bad.png"
/>

<AnimatedFigureCaption style={{ marginTop: '5rem' }}>
Figure 4. Good feedback glows or animates to indicate readiness. Poor feedback appears static, leaving the user unsure.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
Cumulus mandates **glow states** for key elements like buttons and inputs. Glow intensity varies slightly based on component priority. For example, primary buttons may use brighter shadows than tertiary links. **Keyboard focus** must be visible and meet WCAG contrast ratios.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
**Animations** are tuned for smoothness without distraction. A 150ms ease-in-out transition is the default for hover states; active states trigger faster visual confirmation. We never use jarring color jumps or invisible interaction zones.
</FloatInRight>

## üåó Theme-Aware Elevation

<FloatInLeft>
**Elevation** helps users understand depth and hierarchy, but it must do so without glare or distraction. In light mode, elevation uses soft shadows. In dark mode, shadows become harsh, so glows replace them to preserve contrast and comfort.
</FloatInLeft>

<ThemeAdaptiveRuleCard
  title="Card Elevation in Light Mode"

  darkImg="/cumulus-ui-library/img/elevation-light.png"
/>

<AnimatedFigureCaption style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>
Figure 5. Light mode elevation uses soft shadows to imply hierarchy without overloading contrast.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInRight>
Light-mode elevation should feel **natural**. We avoid strong black drop shadows. Instead, layers rise gently with softness. This subtle elevation gives focus without pulling visual weight unnecessarily. Padding within elevated zones still follows spacing tokens.
</FloatInRight>

<ThemeAdaptiveRuleCard

  lightImg="/cumulus-ui-library/img/elevation-dark.png"
  darkImg="/cumulus-ui-library/img/elevation-dark.png"
/>

<AnimatedFigureCaption>

</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
In dark mode, shadow layering often looks muddy. Instead, we use subtle **glows in cyan or teal** that blend into the background. These glows create depth without harshness and help distinguish surfaces in a way that‚Äôs both accessible and polished.
</FloatInLeft>

## ‚úÖ Recap

<FloatInRight>
Style rules are more than guidelines. They are **enforceable constraints** that accelerate development. With shared spacing, typography, component structure, and interactive feedback, teams move faster with fewer decisions and more confidence.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
Cumulus provides reusable systems for **elevation**, **responsive layout**, and **adaptive feedback**. These rules scale across teams, reducing errors and ensuring visual integrity at every level. The system holds steady, even with dozens of contributors.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
When style rules are respected, the product feels fast, elegant, and thoughtfully designed‚Äîeven before any real content appears. These rules build **visual trust** at the very first glance.
</FloatInRight>

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What‚Äôs Next: Auth & Permissions

<FloatInLeft>
With system structure complete, the next frontier is **conditional visibility**. Not all components should show the same content to every user. We‚Äôll explore **role-gated layouts**, **permissions**, and dynamic views next.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
This is where style meets logic. By combining design rules with permission logic, we make interfaces not only beautiful‚Äîbut secure and dynamic. Let‚Äôs continue by enabling components to adapt to user roles.
</FloatInRight>

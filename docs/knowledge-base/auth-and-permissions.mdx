# üîê Auth & Permissions
</FloatInPlace>

---

<FloatInLeft>
A **design system** is more than a visual library. It is a **contract** between the interface and its intended users.  
Color tokens and spacing rules shape aesthetics, but **access logic** shapes who sees what, who can interact, and under what conditions.  
In complex products, this logic cannot remain hidden in the backend; it must be surfaced in the **UI itself**.  
At Cumulus, **permission architecture** is treated as a **first‚Äëclass design concern**.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

Instead of leaving **access control** as an invisible backend detail, we embed that logic directly into components.  
Whether you are building an admin dashboard or a limited‚Äëtier feature, the system ensures that **boundaries are visible, predictable**, and tied directly to **UI states**.  
The sections below introduce key components that model, enforce, and communicate permission flows clearly.
</FloatInLeft>

## Role‚ÄëBased Visibility Matrix

<FloatInLeft>

The foundation of scalable access control is **visibility mapping**.  
The **`RoleVisibilityMatrix`** provides a single reference of which **user roles** can access which **features**, giving product teams a proactive way to plan restrictions.  
It replaces scattered permission checks with a **centralized, visual map** that shows **role‚Äëto‚Äëfeature alignment** at a glance.
</FloatInLeft>


<RoleVisibilityMatrix />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 1.** A visibility matrix showing which roles are granted or restricted from accessing specific interface elements.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
This matrix acts as a **single source of truth**.  
Designers use it for role‚Äëaccurate wireframes, developers use it to enforce boundaries consistently, and QA uses it to validate gated experiences.  
When permissions are clearly documented, assumptions disappear and mismatches between logic and interface become far less likely.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

By exposing access relationships early, the matrix also surfaces **over‚Äëpermissioned roles**, unassigned features, and potential compliance risks.  
When teams align on access intent, downstream bugs and support tickets drop significantly.
</FloatInLeft>

## Permission States in Action

<FloatInLeft>
Access control is rarely just ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff.‚Äù  
Between full access and full restriction are nuanced states: **read‚Äëonly modes**, **disabled controls**, **locked messages**, and **upgrade prompts**.  
The **`PermissionStatePreview`** component visualizes these **intermediate tiers**, helping designers and developers implement them with clarity.
</FloatInLeft>

<PermissionStatePreview />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 2.** Components adapting their structure and interactivity based on different permission tiers.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>

By rendering permission tiers explicitly, users see **why** an element is disabled, not just that it is.  
This transparency strengthens product communication and prevents frustration from unexplained limitations.
</FloatInLeft>


<FloatInLeft>
For developers, this means fewer scattered conditionals and more reliance on **standardized, reusable UI states**.  
Every tier behaves predictably, reducing complexity and making the system more maintainable over time.
</FloatInLeft>

---

## Toggle‚ÄëBased Access Control

<FloatInLeft>

Testing behavior across multiple roles can be time‚Äëconsuming.  
The **`DynamicAccessToggle`** solves this by letting teams simulate roles **instantly**.  
Instead of switching accounts or rebuilding sessions, you can preview how the interface changes as you toggle roles in real time.
</FloatInLeft>


<DynamicAccessToggle />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 3.** Toggle between user roles to preview access changes live without re‚Äëauthenticating.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
This component empowers **PMs, designers, QA, and engineers** to cycle through roles quickly.  
It accelerates testing, eliminates guesswork, and makes misconfigurations obvious before release.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

Live toggling also uncovers **hidden bugs** and layout inconsistencies that might only appear under certain roles.  
For new team members, the toggle acts as a **learning tool**, revealing how permission tiers influence UI behavior.
</FloatInLeft>


---

## Role Tag Legends

<FloatInLeft>
Visual cues help users understand restrictions without confusion.  
The **`RoleTagLegend`** component provides **clear tags and tooltips** to explain why access is limited.  
Instead of assuming a bug, users see context‚Äëaware cues that highlight **requirements or upgrade paths**.
</FloatInLeft>

<RoleTagLegend />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 4.** Role‚Äëbased tags and hover explanations clarify access boundaries directly in the UI.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>

These tags scale from dashboards to pricing pages and adapt across themes.  
They reduce support inquiries, clarify expectations, and maintain user trust.
</FloatInLeft>


<FloatInLeft>
Support teams benefit as well, using tags to troubleshoot roles quickly.  
For product managers, tags act as visible checkpoints confirming that permissions match intended design.
</FloatInLeft>

## Flow of Permission Logic

<FloatInLeft>

Permissions are not static; they **flow through every layer** of your stack.  
The **`PermissionFlowCloud`** visualizes this pipeline from backend identity stores through to UI components, revealing how roles propagate and are enforced.
</FloatInLeft>


<PermissionFlowCloud />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 5.** A diagram tracing role‚Äëbased access from backend to interface, with checkpoints and logic gates.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
This visualization becomes a **shared blueprint** across teams.  
It accelerates debugging, helps explain failures, and improves onboarding by connecting backend logic to visual output.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

Clarity at this level prevents logic drift, improves confidence during refactors, and establishes an **auditable access pattern** that can evolve safely.
</FloatInLeft>


---

## Locked Feature Callouts

<FloatInLeft>
When a feature is restricted, we do not simply hide it.  
The **`LockedFeatureCallout`** component displays a **clear, informative barrier** that explains what is gated and why, often including links to upgrade plans or access requests.
</FloatInLeft>

<LockedFeatureCallout />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 6.** Locked callouts give users guidance on how to unlock or request access, improving transparency and trust.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>

This clarity transforms frustration into understanding.  
Users see that the feature exists, learn why it is unavailable, and know what steps to take next.  
Developers benefit too, with less custom logic required to handle restricted states.
</FloatInLeft>


<FloatInLeft>
Callouts animate smoothly, adapt instantly to role changes, and are ideal for pricing tiers, feature previews, and onboarding journeys.
</FloatInLeft>

## Auditing Access Patterns

<FloatInLeft>

Complex access logic requires **accountability**.  
The **`AccessAuditTrail`** component surfaces detailed logs showing who attempted access, when, and with what result.  
This is invaluable for testing, compliance, and long‚Äëterm support.
</FloatInLeft>


<AccessAuditTrail />

<AnimatedFigureCaption>
**Figure 7.** A simulated log of permission attempts, showing grants and denials with time stamps and role context.
</AnimatedFigureCaption>

<FloatInLeft>
During development, audit trails catch edge cases early.  
During handoffs, they explain why behaviors occur.  
In enterprise settings, they become proof that access logic is applied and enforced consistently.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

Logs can be filtered by role, exported for reviews, and styled to match themes.  
This adaptability makes them valuable in both agile teams and highly regulated environments.
</FloatInLeft>

## Summary

<FloatInLeft>
Cumulus treats access control as **design infrastructure**, not an afterthought.  
Every component: tags, matrices, callouts, and toggles, transforms abstract logic into **clear, usable communication**.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

By aligning **visual patterns with logical rules**, we reduce development time, increase product quality, and build **lasting user trust**.  
Permissions are no longer hidden, they are integrated into the design system itself.
</FloatInLeft>

## What‚Äôs Next: Onboarding

<FloatInLeft>
Access control defines what users can do. **Onboarding** defines what users can understand, learn, and adopt.  
The next section explores how Cumulus brings **role‚Äëaware education**, **guided component previews**, and **interactive pathways** to accelerate learning and confidence.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInLeft>

Onboarding is the bridge between restriction and mastery.  
It shows teams not just what roles exist but how to use them effectively.  
Let us move forward into that journey and see how we turn permission logic into actionable guidance.

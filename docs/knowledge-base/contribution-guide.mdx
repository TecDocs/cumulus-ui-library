# ‚úçÔ∏è Contribution Guide
</FloatInPlace>

<FloatInLeft>
A design system is more than a library of components, it is a shared contract between teams. Every button, badge, layout rule, or token reflects an intent: how we scale consistency, performance, and visual identity across products. Without contributors who think systemically, the design system begins to lose coherence. Updates drift apart, patterns become isolated, and logic splinters into fragments.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
At Cumulus, we approach contribution as a systemic act, not an isolated gesture. Whether you're proposing a new component or refining a spacing token, your work contributes to the underlying infrastructure. Contributions are not temporary, they are structural. That is why everything submitted must be reusable, documented, theme-aware, and accessible by default.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
This guide is your reference for making contributions that align with Cumulus standards. You will learn what qualifies as a system-ready component, how tokens are structured and applied, how documentation is written, and how reviewers evaluate your pull request. This is not just a submission pipeline, it is a shared learning model.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
When you contribute effectively, your work becomes more than a patch. It becomes a foundation, a pattern, and a teaching artifact. A single component might power five interfaces, support multiple themes, or inform years of future development. This guide shows you how to build that kind of impact.

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Contribution Personas

<FloatInLeft>
Contributors do not all come from the same background. Designers shape visual intent. Developers implement logic and tokens. Writers craft documentation and language patterns. QA teams validate accessibility, edge cases, and compliance. These different roles are not silos, they are perspectives that strengthen the system.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Understanding your persona helps you design contributions with broader awareness. Developers consider token compliance and interactive states. Designers focus on semantic color usage and layout intent. Writers think about onboarding clarity and glossary terms. Each brings unique value, but the expectations remain shared across roles.
</FloatInRight>

<ContributionPersonaRow />

<FloatInLeft>
You are not expected to know everything about every role, but you are expected to understand how your contribution affects others. A designer who understands token usage can name them more clearly. A developer who understands documentation flow can create more teachable props. A writer who grasps component behavior can clarify its interaction model. This is what systemic thinking looks like in practice.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
This shared awareness creates a system where contributions do not conflict or drift. They align. They extend. They anticipate. Now let us explore what elevates a component from functional to system-ready.

## üîß What Makes a Good Component?

<FloatInLeft>
In a local codebase, it is enough for a component to work. But in a system like Cumulus, it must scale. A system-ready component must support theming, use tokens consistently, include all interaction states, and be accessible out of the box. It should not assume hardcoded styles or static values. It must be legible to developers and predictable for users.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
A strong component is not just usable‚Äîit is teachable. Its structure reveals design intent. Its props are expressive. Its logic is modular. When others read your code or documentation, they should feel confident using it without hesitation. Trust is earned through predictability, clarity, and repeatability. That is what separates a one-off widget from a reusable system element.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
Tokenization is where this begins. Avoid pixel values, use spacing tokens. Avoid raw color values, use semantic tokens. Avoid motion shortcuts, use motion tokens. If your component uses `--spacing-md`, `--color-bg-surface`, and `--easing-fade`, then your work becomes instantly adaptable across light/dark themes, accessibility needs, and branding shifts.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
From there, focus on interactivity. Every state‚Äîhover, focus, active, disabled, error‚Äîshould be represented and documented. Storybook is not optional. It is your system mirror. If a user might encounter a state, you must preview and test it. Include edge cases. Include responsiveness. A component that only works at one screen size or in one color mode is not system-ready.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
And then there is documentation. It is not a nice-to-have, it is the other half of your work. Your `.mdx` file should explain intent, token usage, edge cases, keyboard access, and usage scenarios. It should use `<CloudFigure>` for visuals, `<HoverExplain>` for tooltips, and narrative sections that educate others. This is where your work becomes part of a living system.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
This visual contrast is what we see in reviews every week. Contributors who skip tokenization, Storybook states, or documentation slow the system. Contributors who follow this model multiply the system. When your work scales, it becomes not just helpful, but durable. Let us now look at how that durability is built through the full contribution lifecycle.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è From Design to Merge: The Lifecycle

<FloatInLeft>
Every contribution begins with design intent. Whether it's a new component or a token update, you must articulate what you are solving and why. What is the use case? What system gap are you addressing? Clear intent helps prevent duplication and guides reviewers toward approval.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Then comes the token proposal. Visual values must be abstracted into reusable design tokens. If you are introducing a new spacing or background style, create a token for it. Token proposals must follow naming conventions and fit into the semantic structure. They are the connective tissue between design and implementation.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
Next is development. You build the component using semantic markup, tokenized styling, keyboard support, and interaction logic. The code must support light and dark themes, respect user preferences, and work across common breakpoints. If you cannot test it in multiple modes, it is not system-ready.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
With code in place, you write your Storybook preview. Every state must be shown. Use controls to demonstrate prop changes. Cover loading, error, success, and interactive states. Test responsiveness and color modes. Storybook is not just a demo‚Äîit is your contribution‚Äôs proof of coverage.
</FloatInRight>

<FloatInLeft>
Now, documentation. Create a `.mdx` file with a FloatIn introduction, CloudFigures, glossary terms, and long-form explanation. Teach the intent and usage clearly. Your component must educate as well as perform. If documentation is skipped or vague, the system loses clarity.
</FloatInLeft>

<ContributionFlowCloud
  steps={[
    "Design Intent",
    "Token Proposal",
    "Component Development",
    "Storybook Preview",
    "Documentation",
    "PR Submission",
    "Review + Merge"
  ]}
/>

<FloatInRight>
Once documentation is in place, open your PR. Write a clear summary, include screenshots, link to designs, and explain your tokens. Your PR should be a snapshot of the entire lifecycle, not just a diff of code. Show your thought process, not just your file tree.
</FloatInRight>

<CloudFigure imageSrc="/cumulus-ui-library/img/contribution-lifecycle-placeholder.png" caption="Figure 4. The contribution lifecycle from idea to merge." />

<FloatInLeft>
During review, every layer is inspected. Are tokens used correctly? Are all states covered in Storybook? Is documentation clear? Is the component responsive and accessible? If your submission walks the full lifecycle, review is fast. If it skips steps, it slows the team. Review is not about nitpicking, it is about verifying system integrity.
</FloatInLeft>

<FloatInRight>
Once approved and merged, your contribution becomes part of the system‚Äôs knowledge base. It becomes referenceable. It teaches others. And it lives beyond its original author. That is what system-ready means. It is not about style, it is about stability and continuity.
</FloatInRight>

##  Recap and What‚Äôs Next
<FloatInLeft> A successful contribution does not start with code. It begins with awareness. Awareness of system principles, token standards, accessibility expectations, and documentation clarity. By walking through the full lifecycle‚Äîfrom intent to merge‚Äîyou build components that others can trust, extend, and learn from. You contribute not just features, but structure. </FloatInLeft> <FloatInRight> Every part of this guide has reinforced the idea that design systems are not maintained by individuals, but by systems of process and shared understanding. That understanding must show up in your Storybook previews, your token usage, your accessibility practices, and your documentation flow. It is not a burden‚Äîit is a multiplier. </FloatInRight> <FloatInLeft> In the next section, we will explore the foundational standards that every contributor must respect: accessibility. You will learn how keyboard interaction, screen reader support, color contrast, and tokenized styling come together to define what is acceptable inside a system. Accessibility is not a final step, it is a continuous filter across everything you write, build, and review. </FloatInLeft> <FloatInRight> By mastering contribution practices, you are now prepared to take your work to a higher standard‚Äîone that includes every user, regardless of ability or environment. Let us move into the accessibility section and define how inclusivity becomes a baseline expectation for every component in Cumulus. </FloatInRight>
